                    The CCAI project is an interdisciplinary project aimed at creating images of accurate,
                    vivid, and personalized outcomes of climate change. Our goal is to use cutting-edge
                    machine learning techniques to produce images of how neighborhoods and houses will look
                    like following the effects of global warming. By creating a more visceral understanding
                    of the effects of climate change, we aim to strengthen public support for necessary
                    actions and motivate people to make impactful decisions. As a prototype, we first focus
                    on modeling flood consequences on homes.
